                      Xygos 0.1

                 a variant of Angband


............................................................

Far in the future, a network of civilisations - human and
otherwise - spans the galaxy. One man wants to seize control
and rule them all, beginning with this planet Xygos.

Extensively nuked from orbit, life survives in the corners
which escaped the worst of the bombardment and were lucky
enough to have somewhere below ground to retreat to.

To avoid the same destruction spread across the galaxy,
someone needs to infiltrate the fortress and defeat him.

You have taken on that role. The ultimate mission is
always the same - to descend to level 100 of the Fortress
and defeat the Emperor.

You can get there in many ways though and your first
decision is to choose what kind of hero you will be - a
Space Marine's combat skill, a speedy Pilot or an
Engineer's techniques? Human, Android or a Cyborg - a bit
of both? Or even a tourist or a flying superhero?

............................................................

For new players though - especially if you are new to
Angband as well as to Xygos - a good way to start is with
a "tank". So select Android, Super, Athletic, Soldier and
Point-based.
Accept the default points distribution, and exit talents
(you can come back to it later).
Get some lights, curing pills, blinking cards and if you
have the spare cash some basic armor (check out the Field HQ
first - it's only available to Marines, and beats the other
stores).
And get down that >!
Oh, and don't forget to visit the HQ again when you return.
You will get prizes for returning after being promoted.
