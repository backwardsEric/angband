# 'name' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new class.

# 'stats' is for the stat modifiers - strength, intelligence, wisdom,
# dexterity, constitution.

# 'skill-<skill name>' is for skills - physical and magical disarming,
# magic devices, saving throws, stealth, to hit (normal), to hit (bows),
# to hit (throwing), digging.  The base entry is what gets added to the
# character's skills at birth, the increments are added to the base skill
# every ten levels.

# 'hitdie' is for additional average hitpoints gained at maximum level.

# 'info' is for extra info - max. hitpoints gained per level, experience
# factor in percent.

# 'attack' is for attack info - maximum possible number of attacks, minimum
# weapon weight for calculating the number of attacks, multiplier for
# attack calculations.

# 'equip' is for starting equipment - tval of the item, sval of the item,
# minimum amount, maximum amount.

# 'flags' is for class flags.

# 'title' is for class titles.
# There can be any number of them - max 12 chars if possible (13 would mean
# overlapping the blank space on the char sheet and mani display, more won't
# be seen.)

# 'magic' is for general magic info - level of the first spell, weight that
# hurts spells, number of books used.

# 'book' defines one of these books - object base, whether a town or a dungeon
# book, name, number of spells, book realm.  A book needs to be defined for
# each class which uses it, as otherwise it is not recognised as one of that
# class's books.

# 'book-graphics' is for symbol and color as used in object.txt.
# 'book-graphics:' lines refer to the previous book line, and need not be
# included if a book of the same name has been defined earlier.

# 'book-properties' is for object properties of a book - cost, commonness,
# and minimum and maximum depths of occurrence.
# 'book-properties:' lines refer to the previous book line, and need not be
# included if a book of the same name has been defined earlier.

# 'spell' defines an individual spell - name, level, mana required,
# fail-rate, experience for first casting.    'spell:' lines always refer to
# spells in the previous 'book:' line.  The lines below are all used in
# reference to the previous 'spell:' line.

# 'effect' defines the spell effect (as listed in src/list-effects.h),
# and optionally parameters for effect subtype, effect radius and
# an extra parameter for various things

# 'dice' provides a random value to be used by an effect (for damage,
# healing, etc).  As well as the normal random value fields described above,
# it can contain expressions like $B, which refer forward to an 'expr' line.

# 'expr' provides an expression for use in effect dice.  It consists of a
# code letter (eg B) for the expression, a base function to use (for example
# PLAYER_LEVEL), and a sequence of operations to perform on that base.

# 'seffect-msg' provides a message which can be used in whatever way the effect
# needs, typically to print during the effect, or as a death message.

# 'desc' is for description. As many desc: lines may be used as are needed
# to describe the spell. Note that lines will need spaces at their
# ends or the beginning of the next line to prevent words from running
# together.

cdesc:You are trained and equipped for underground exploration, can avoid falls and will gain powerful abilities to dig, climb, map, detect and find hidden passages.

cdesc:Jedi are famous for skill with a lightsaber - you'll excel with melee energy weapons and do well with other melee weapons. Eventually you'll even be able to construct your own. Ranged weapons are not you, but you'll be supported by a number of subtle powers as you advance. There are also Dark Jedi... who are powerful, yes, but at a cost!
