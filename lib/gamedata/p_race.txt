That [blas] in the lowest experience requirement and the most specialization through talents.

desc:Sentient robots have been constructed for a variety of purposes and while artificial intelligence still isn't as good as the real thing, they have many advantages: a tough, fast metal body, precise aiming, rapid regeneration and IR vision.
