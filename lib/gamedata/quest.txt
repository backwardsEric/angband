# quest.txt

# This file contains the fixed (and only) quests.  The current system is that
# a copy of these is made into the player data at birth, and the level field
# in that copy is zeroed when the quest is completed.  This system could be
# improved; it could also be easily adapted to add more fixed quests (by adding
# to this file).  It would also only require fairly small game code changes to
# allow other quests to be added as a result of game events.
