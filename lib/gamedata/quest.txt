# quest.txt

# This file contains the fixed (and only) quests.  The current system is that
# a copy of these is made into the player data at birth, and the level field
# in that copy is zeroed when the quest is completed.  This system could be
# improved; it could also be easily adapted to add more fixed quests (by adding
# to this file).  It would also only require fairly small game code changes to
# allow other quests to be added as a result of game events.

intro:There's a cellar out back. It's full of rats. Are you up for cleaning them out?
desc:Deal with the rats in the cellar
succeed:So you've cleaned them out? Great. Maybe some day Nijel - who is not exactly a little kid any more after all - will learn to muck out his own pets. But as you clearly care about animals I hope you will appreciate some rat treats along with the $200 cash.
failure:So you were defeated by a mouse? How heroic! Brave Sir Robin would be proud.
