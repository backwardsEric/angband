# File: death.txt

# This file is used to initialize the mine explosion messages for the game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.

# That said, it isn't difficult. Just keep each message on one line,
# less than 80 characters, and start each line with D:

# Format: 
# D:Mine explosion message.
#
# 	(e.g.)	The proximity mine wakes up.
#			The proximity mine exclaims: "I think, therefore I think I will explode."
#			The proximity mine explodes!
