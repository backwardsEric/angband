# This file contains the abilities - talents, mutations, etc.

### - description - ###
# name:<name>			-	A name which must match a player flag in list-player-flags.h, e.g. "Thick_Brain".
#								Case is ignored (it would match the THICK_BRAIN flag). Underscores are printed as spaces
#								("Thick Brain").
# gain:<text>			-	gain message, e.g. "You grow a thick brain!"
# lose:<text>			-	loss message, e.g. "Your thick brain shrivels away!"
# brief:<text>			-	brief one-line description, e.g. "You have a thick brain."
# desc:<text>			-	full description (may be multiple lines), e.g. "You have a thick brain, and it
# 								makes you thick."
# desc_future:<text>	- 	optional (if not present, desc is used) used in choosing a talent which you do
# 								not yet have, e.g. "you would have a thick brain, and it would make you thick."


### - for talents - ###
# cost:<value>			-	If present, the ability is a talent, it has a cost (in talent points) and it can be bought.
# minlevel:<level>		-	If present, the minimum level needed to gain the talent.
# maxlevel:<level>		-	If present, the maximum level needed - 0 for both is the default and means "any level".
#								Talents gained during character creation respect the minimum level (if it's above 1 you can't
#								take it), but also see the "birth" flag.

### - interactions - ###
# forbid:<talent>		-	This forbids another ability from being gained if this ability is already present. This may be
#							given any number of times. Usually this is wanted in both directions (set forbid:A on B, and
#							forbid:B on A), although this is not required.
# require:<talent>		-	This prevents this ability from being gained unless this ability is already present. This may be
#							given any number of times.

### - misc - ###

#						-	birth		- If set, the ability can only be gained at character creation.
#						-	mutation	- If set, the ability can be gained as a mutation.
#						-	talent		- If set, the ability may be gained as a talent.
