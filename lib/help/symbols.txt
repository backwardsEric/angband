Symbols On Your Map
===================

Symbols on your map can be broken down into three categories: Features of
the dungeon such as walls, floor, doors, and traps; Objects which can be
picked up such as treasure, weapons, devices, etc; and creatures which may
or may not move about the dungeon, but are mostly harmful to your
character's well being.

Some symbols are used to represent more than one type of entity, and some
symbols are used to represent entities in more than one category. The "@"
symbol (by default) is used to represent the character.

It will not be necessary to remember all of the symbols and their meanings.
The "slash" command ('/') will identify any character appearing on your
map (see 'commands.txt').

Note that you can use a "user pref file" to change any of these symbols to
something you are more comfortable with.
