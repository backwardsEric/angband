====================
Creating a Character
====================

Xygos is a roleplaying game, in which you, the player, control a
character in the world of Xygos. Perhaps the most important thing you
control is the birth of your character, in which you choose or allow to be
chosen various attributes that will affect the future life of your
character.

At the character creation screen you will be prompted to select the
race, extension, personality and class of your character. You also have
the option to change the 'birth options' at this time. These need to be
set at the character creation menu and cannot be altered later in the game.
They are discussed with the rest of the options in the "options" help file.
You will also be asked to select talents. Most can be gained at any time
in the game (press ``S``), but there are a few which can only take effect
at birth. 

Character Characteristics
=========================

Each character has four primary attributes: race, extension, personality
and class. These are chosen at the beginning and - with some exceptions
described below - will stay fixed for the entire life of that character.
The race, extension and class have many effects which are discussed in
detail below.

Each character has a few secondary attributes: height, weight, and
background history. These are randomly determined according to the race of
the character, and are only used to provide flavour to the character to
assist in role playing.  There is an opportunity to edit background history
during character birth.

Each character also has seven primary "stats": strength, intelligence,
wisdom, dexterity, constitution, charism and speed; they modify the
abilities of the character in a variety of ways. Every stat has a numerical
value, ranging from a minimum of 3, up to a normal maximum of 18, and even
higher, into the "percentile" range, represented as '18/01' through '18/220'.
There is a maximum that can be achieved intrinsically, for any given stat,
which is in the region of 18/100. The stats can be modified further by
equipment, race and class bonuses up to the maximum of '18/220'.

Each character also has several primary "skills": disarming, devices,
saving throws, stealth, searching ability, fighting skill, shooting skill, 
and digging skill, which are derived from the character's race,
class, level, stats, and current equipment. These skills have rather 
obvious effects, but will be described more completely below.

Each character may have one or more "racially intrinsic skills", based on
the race of the character. These may include special resistances, or
abilities such as infravision.

Each character has a number of "experience points", which increases as the
character defeats monsters and attempts new spells and uses new items.
Characters also have a level, which is based on experience. The amount of
experience required to gain a new level is dependent on the character race
and class. Races and classes with more intrinsic benefits require more
experience to gain levels. As the experience rises, so does the level, and
as the level rises, certain other abilities and characteristics rise as
well. All characters start at 0 experience and at the first level.

Each character has some cash, which can be used to buy items from the shops
in the town, and which can be obtained not only from selling items to the
shops, but also by taking it from dead monsters and by finding it in the
dungeon. Each character starts out with some cash, the amount of which is
based on the character's stats (less powerful characters start with more
gold). Each character also starts out with a few useful items, which may be
kept, or sold to a shop-keeper for more cash.   However, especially valuable
items will never sell for the full price, as each shopkeeper has a maximum
that they are prepared to pay for any item. The more generous shopkeepers
may buy your items for up to $50,000: but some are really stingy, and will
pay no more than $5,000.

Each character has an "armour class", abbreviated to AC, representing how
well the character can avoid damage. The armour class is affected by
dexterity and equipment, so the concept includes both avoiding blows and
being able to take blows without being hurt. Armour class on equipment is
always denoted in square brackets, usually as a figure of '[X,+Y]' where
X is the intrinsic AC of the armour in question, and Y is the enhancement
bonus to armour class provided by that item.

Each character has "hit points", or hp, representing how much damage the
character can sustain before they die. How many hit points a character has
is determined by race, class, level and constitution, as follows: each race
has a basic "hit dice" number - for instance, a Dwarf's basic hit die is
11, while a hobbit's is 7. This is modified by class: for instance, a
warrior gets a +9 bonus to the hit die, while a mage gets no bonus and a
priest +2, so a dwarven warrior's total hit die will be (11+9)=20 - meaning
that they get between 1 and 20 hit points per level. If they were a priest,
his hit dice would be (11+2)=13, and get between 1 and 13 hit points per
level. The hobbit mage would get only 1-7 hps per level. (All characters
get the maximum at first level: thereafter it is a random roll of 1dX where
X is the hit die number, when the character goes up in level.) This is
further modified by constitution - a character with high constitution will
get a flat bonus of a certain number of hit points per level (recalculated
right back to level 1: if you gain an extra hit point per level, and you
are 42nd level, you will suddenly be 42 hit points better off.)

Lastly, each character has a base speed. (Speed is a stat, but behaves
differently enough from the others to be descibed separately.)
Speed determines the amount of "energy" your character acquires in the
game, and therefore how often you can take actions which use up energy
(like moving or attacking). Beginning characters move at close to normal
speed (you may be slightly faster through putting points into the speed
stat). The most accessible way to speed up are whizz pills, which are
often found early on. Characters who are carrying too much weight will
move more slowly. Extra speed is one of the most important boons in the
game and therefore one of the rarest and most sought after. Speed should
be distinguished from moves. Moves ("move speed") only takes effect when
you are walking - fighting and other actions aren't affected. It's still
useful, but nowhere near as powerful as speed.

Races
=====
 
Each race has its own adjustments to a character's stats and abilities. 
Most races also have intrinsic abilities.  The bonuses to statistics and 
the experience penalty will be displayed next to the races as you move 
to select one.

.. _Human:

Human
  The human is the base character.  All other races are compared to them.
  Humans are average at everything and tend to go up levels faster than any
  other race due to their shorter life spans.  No racial adjustments or 
  intrinsics occur to human characters.  Humans do not have any infravision.
  Humans can choose to be a Mutant, Super or Cyborg.

.. _Android:

Android
  Androids are strong, agile, tough and fast - but lack intelligence,
  wisdom and charisma. They gain few if any talents, and can be a Super but
  not a Cyborg (they are 100% electronic already!) or a Mutant (as they are
  innately immune to mutation). They can't eat food and must live on
  batteries. They regenerate quickly (like Terminator) but can't swim and
  are susceptible to electricity (they need one level of resistance to be
  back to normal). They have native IR vision.

.. _Time-Lord:

Time-Lord
  Time Lords take a human form, which changes when they regenerate. They can
  regenerate as many as 12 times, but it is always chancy - especially for
  the less experienced, and experience is not so easily gained (they have
  seen it all before). They have a number of space/time related techniques
  available, and are smarter, wiser, tougher and more charismatic than the
  average human. They also have a few good skills (devices and throwing
  especially), and regenerate quickly. They can be Mutants, Cyborgs or
  Supers.

Extensions
==========

You can optionally "extend" the race - these extensions add their own
abilities, bonuses to statistics and skills, and experience penalty.

.. _None:

	Extensions are optional. You can always select the unmodified race
	alone.

.. _Mutant:

	Mutants begin with one or more mutations - which although they may
	have disadvantages are not purely negative. They will gain at least one
	more mutation as they advance, and will gain the ability to exchange
	unwanted mutations for ones that may be preferable - and eventually,
	to withstand radiation innately.
	They have a small experience penalty, reduced hit points and reduced
	stats - strength, intelligence, dexterity, constitution and (especially)
	charisma.

,, _Cyborg:

	Cyborgs begin with one or more cybernetic implants. These are varied
	and generally powerful, but becoming used to these new abilities means
	less time for learning other things. So they have less talents
	available, and more experience is needed to advance - especially early on.
	They also start as members of the Cyber Salon.

Personalities
=============

All characters have a personality, which affects stats, skills, and
sometimes talents, hit points and experience.

.. _Ordinary:
	An average personality with no further changes made. This is the
	simplest and not a bad choice for any character, so if you don't want to
	care about personalities this is the one to go for. However it will
	rarely be the best choice, either - most classes benefit from enhancing
	their positive characteristics or (less often) shoring up their weak
	points. 

.. _Geeky:
	Intelligent, curious and having acquired much background knowledge of
	pre-War equipment and such esoterica - but at a cost to combat skills,
	physical stats and hitpoints. It's an obvious choice for an Engineer,
	reinforcing that class's strong points - but it can also be used with
	other classes that would benefit from learning more talents and more
	reliable use of devices.
	Geeky characters gain intelligence and wisdom, a talent point and
	device and disarming skills, at the cost of other stats, other skills
	and hit points.

.. _Sneaky:
	A sneaky sneak. A creepy creep. Stealth is a Sneaky character's strong
	point, and they can usually manage to bypass a lock, avoid a trap, find
	hidden goodies and jump out of the way in the nick of time - eventually
	becoming so aware of their surroundings as to be entirely immune to traps.
	They are not bad fighters but are best with lightweight melee and
	improvised thrown weapons. They're also smart enough to be able to back
	that up with devices.
	Sneaky characters gain bonuses to most skills, intelligence, wisdom,
	speed and especially dexterity. They lose out on strength, constitution
	and charisma.

.. _Lazy:
	A reluctant hero - "What, me? Run around all day in some slimy
	underground passages? Sounds awful." A lazy character would much rather
	take the load off in front of VaulTV. But the galaxy won't save itself,
	so here they are... They are sub-par in most respects but the lack of
	experience translates to an improved experience modifier and an extra
	talent point. They also have no danger-level time limit.
	Lazy characters are worse at all stats and all skills.

.. _Boring:
	Boring characters aren't stealthy (as they can't stop talking for long)
	but are used to evading thrown eggs and digging of course is a
	specialty. They gain strength and constitution, lose wisdom and a lot
	of charisma and have two powers: "Monologue" puts everyone to sleep,
	while "Bore" literally bores your way through the floor or ceiling.

.. _Shouty:
	Shouty characters like Karen and Dick are never wrong, ever. Just ask
	them. They are used to rushing in quickly and making their presence
	felt - aggravating everyone else, but they don't give a rodent's
	posterior about that. Their real talent though is an ability to yell
	until everyone respects their authority. (That translates to a sonic
	blast: a cone of sound that becomes more powerful as they advance.)
	Their ability to attract facepunches has given them a decent ability
	in melee, especially when unarmed combat plus a hitpoint boost. On
	the down side, they are about as stealthy as a howler monkey and
	don't have the patience to search or disarm. They aggravate monsters
	and have a large penalty to charisma, a small penalty to intelligence
	but a bonus to wisdom and speed.

.. _Athletic:
	Athletes have good physical abilities in general but are especially
	noted for speed. This personality is a good match for most classes,
	even ones where the penalties matter - as these characters are also
	the squishier ones, and benefit from being able to run away.
	Athletes get extra movespeed. Also hit points, strength, dexterity,
	constitution and speed. They do lose intelligence and wisdom, and have
	a significant experience penalty. Their fighting skills are good, but
	they are bad with devices.

.. _Greedy:
	A greedy character may save the galaxy while they are there - why not?
	- but their main motivation is cold, hard cash. There's loot down there
	and they want it! Their attentiveness to shiny things means they notice
	more of it - eventually being able to sense metal at a distance. But it
	also makes it harder for them to focus on anything else - skills other
	than searching and digging suffer, and they lose wisdom and charisma.
	They gain the Find Loot technique which detects nearby cash and items.
	They have a small hitpoint penalty.

.. _Chicken:
	This is a character whose preferred reaction to danger is to run and
	hide like a chicken. This hurts melee ability and doesn't make them very
	popular either. However, they are OK with fighting from 200 yards away,
	they are stealthy and they are used to running. Their survival instincts
	also give you a little more HP and AC.
	Chickens have extra move speed, intelligence, wisdom and constitution
	but reduced charisma.

.. _Fearless:
	Fearless characters are effective melee combatants but prone to failing
	to defend themselves. So they have reduced constitution, hit points and
	AC, though their charisma and speed is boosted. Onward to the next
	adventure!

.. _Scrub:
	Scrubs have no advantages, and a lot of disadvantages - very poor stats,
	skills and hitpoints. They are a challenge personality - something to
	select if the usual game isn't tough enough for you. You get a 25% score
	bonus for accepting this challenge.

.. _Munchkin:
	Munchkins get it easy. Exceptional starting items, huge bonuses to
	everything, fast leveling, and no penalties besides a whopping 90% off
	their final score - as this is of course an easy mode, and if you win
	as a Munchkin you should not brag too much about it. The Princess is in
	another castle...

.. _Split:
	These characters' personality changes unpredictably. Every level up a
	new personality develops at random. It is sometimes possible to avert
	this by an effort of will - but this isn't guaranteed and you often
	won't know what the alternative is. However, they do get better at it
	as they gain levels and wisdom, extreme personalities don't usually
	stick and they will be given free choice of personality if they reach
	maximum level.

Classes
=======

Once a race, extension and personality have been chosen, you will need to
pick a class.  The class is the character's occupation and determines stat
bonuses, abilities, hit dice, and what techniques (if any) the character
can learn.

.. _Soldier:

Soldier
  A Soldier is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most problems
  by cutting them to pieces, but will occasionally fall back on the help of
  a device. Their prime stats are strength, constitution, and dexterity,
  and they will strike more blows with melee weapons than any other class.
  A Soldier will be excellent at fighting, shooting and throwing, but bad
  at most other skills, with bad stealth and no class techniques. A Soldier
  has great hit points, few talents and has access to the Field HQ building
  for buying equipment and collecting rewards for promotions.

.. _Marksman:

Marksman
  A Marksman is a civilian weapon expert, reasonably skilled with all ranged
  weapons and the best of any role with their chosen specialty. Being used
  to firing at paper targets which rarely fire back though, their melee
  combat and stealth abilities are not so hot. They start being able to
  recognize all weapon mods. They have middling hit points and most skills,
  escept for shooting and throwng which they are excellent at. They have
  a small bonus to strength and a large one to dexterity.

.. _Wrestler:

Wrestler
  A Wrestler has great martial arts skill, mediocre other skills and more
  hit points than any other class. They have large bonuses to strength,
  constitution and dexterity and gain numerous powers as they level up:
  regeneration, immunity to fear, free action, immunity to stunning,
  protection from confusion, sustained strength, constitution, dexterity
  and speed, and ultimately hold life. They are only effective fighters
  with minimal armor and no weapon, though - the intrinsic powers are to
  make up for the ones that would have been gained from armor.

.. Clown_:

Clown
  A clown is a master of deception, misdirection and custard pies. They
  can perform impressive card tricks and are a great shot with a thrown
  knife or more exotic weapons (it's always best to kill your enemies in
  a humorous way, after all). And when it turns out that they shouldn't
  have brought a pie to a gun fight, some useful athletic techniques may
  speed their escape.
  Clown have lowish hit points and few talents. They are average fighters,
  being especially good with thrown weapons.

.. _Pilot:

Pilot
  A pilot flies a cavespeeder, giving increased speed (in straight lines)
  which improves with skill. They can also avoid pits, lava and similar
  ground hazards but must be aware that a jet engine wakes the heaviest
  sleepers. Later they can upgrade to a fighter, equipped with a plasma
  cannon - or a racer, for extra speed.
  Pilots have middling hit points and fighting ability and rely on their
  speed for superiority.

.. _Tourist:

Tourist
  A fun class but not an easy one. Tourists are well equipped, for the
  beach. They are in fact rather out of your depth - definitely a
  challenge class. But they do have some advantages - a universal map,
  a winning smile, some spending money and (due to being the least
  experienced role) the best experience and talent gain rates.
  Tourists have poor hit points and average fighting ability, with
  throwing being better than other fighting skills. They get few skills
  early but many later. They have a penalty to strength, a large penalty
  to wisdom and a bonus to charisma.

.. _Spelunker:

Spelunker
  A spelunker is trained and equipped for underground exploration, can
  avoid falls and will gain powerful abilities to dig, climb, map, detect
  and find hidden passages. Their combat ability is middling - fitness
  helps but only so much without having practiced much. However they can
  become effective tactical fighters through their positioning abilities.
  Spelunkers have above average hit points, are reasonably good at most
  skills, and have bonuses to physical stats. 

.. _Jedi:

Jedi
  Jedi are famous for skill with a lightsaber - they excel with melee
  energy weapons and do well with other melee weapons. Eventually they'll
  even be able to construct your own. Ranged weapons are not something they
  like dealing with, but they will be supported by a number of subtle
  powers as they advance. There are also Dark Jedi... who are powerful,
  yes, but at a cost!
  Jedi have modest bonuses to all stats but large ones to wisdom and
  dexterity. They gain a talent later on and have a moderate experience
  penalty.

.. _Engineer:

Engineer
  Devices are their strength - they'll know most on sight, and know how to
  get the best out of them too. While they aren't much of a fighter in
  general, they do know energy weapons (melee and ranged) and can see any
  machine or cyborg's weak points. They also excel with printers and item
  related cards, and will gain a few skills to use items in unexpected ways.
  Engineers have the lowest of any class's hit points, lots of talents and
  great device and disarm skills. They have a large bonus to intelligence,
  a small one to wisdom, and penalties to dexterity and charisma.

Stats
=====

After race, extension, personality and class are selected, you will be able
to decide what stat levels your character will have, by allocating a finite
number of "points" between the seven statistics.  These points can be
allocated  by selection or with a random roller (as described below in the
"Stat Rollers" section).  Each race/class combination also has a recommended 
default setting for these statistics.  Statistics can be permanently 
raised by various pills in the dungeon.  They can also be temporarily
drained by some monster attacks.

Strength
  Strength is important in fighting with weapons and in melee combat. A
  high strength can improve your chances of hitting as well as the amount
  of damage done with each hit. Characters with low strengths may receive
  penalties. Strength raises the amount of weight you can carry before
  being slowed. It also allows you to get extra blows with heavier weapons.
  Strength is one of the most important stats in the beginning of the game.
 
Intelligence
  Intelligence affects the spellcasting abilities of spellcasters from the
  arcane and shadow realms: mages, rogues, necromancers and blackguards.
  Intelligence will affect the number of spells you may learn each level as
  well as the number of spell points you receive. Intelligence is the most
  important stat for mages and necromancers. A high intelligence may also
  improve your chances of successfully casting a spell. You cannot learn
  spells if your intelligence is 7 or lower. A good intelligence can also
  help with using magic devices, picking locks, and disarming traps.
 
Wisdom
  The primary function of wisdom is to determine the ability of a priest or
  paladin to use prayers, and druids and rangers to use verses, just like
  intelligence affects spellcasting. Again, high wisdom will increase the
  number of mana points you have and increase the number of prayers or verses
  you can learn each level, while improving your chance of success. A good
  wisdom increases your saving throw, thereby improving your chances of
  resisting magical spells cast upon you by monsters.
 
Dexterity
  Dexterity is a combination of agility and quickness. A high dexterity may
  allow a character to get multiple blows with lighter weapons. Dexterity
  also increases a character's chances of hitting with any weapon and of
  dodging blows from enemies. Dexterity is also useful in picking locks,
  disarming traps, protecting yourself from some of the thieves that
  inhabit the dungeons, and (for rogues) stealing successfully from others.
  If the character has a high enough dexterity, thieves will never
  be successful in stealing from them.
 
Constitution
  Constitution is a character's ability to resist damage to his body, and
  to recover from damage received. Therefore a character with a high
  constitution will receive more hit points and also recover them faster
  while resting. Constitution is less important in the beginning of the
  game, but will be the most important stat at the end.

Charisma
  Charisma affects your ability to persuade shopkeepers to give you a good
  price. There are also some techniques that use it as their controlling
  stat, but despite that it's considerably less important than the main five
  stats. To reflect this it is much cheaper to buy when selecting stats than
  the main five stats.

Speed
  Speed affects how quickly you move, act, fight - almost everything in fact
  is proportional to this stat. Having 10 is average - each additional point
  of stat gives you another point of speed, and about another 10% actions in
  the same time. Because speed affects how effectively you do everything,
  it is considerably more valuable that the other stats and costs much more
  to buy.

Skills
======

Characters possess some different skills which can help them to survive.  
The starting skill levels of a character are based upon race and class.  
Skill levels may be adjusted by high or low stats, and may increase with 
the level of the character.

Infravision
  Infravision is the ability to see heat sources. Since most of the dungeon
  is cool or cold, infravision will not allow the player to see walls and
  objects. Infravision will allow a character to see any warm-blooded
  creatures up to a certain distance. This ability works equally well with
  or without a light source. However, some of Angband's creatures are
  cold-blooded, and will not be detected unless lit up by a light source.
  Some characters may have innate infravision, while others must rely on
  their equipment to provide it. Infravision does not increase with
  character level, and is purely dependent on the character's innate
  abilities and on their equipment.
 
Fighting
  Fighting is the ability to hit and do damage with weapons or fists.
  Normally a character gets a single blow from any weapon, but with
  high enough dexterity and strength may receive more blows with
  lighter weapons. Strength and dexterity both modify the ability to hit an
  opponent. This skill increases with the level of the character. Inspecting
  a weapon will show you how quickly you can attack with it.

Shooting Ability
  Using ranged missile weapons (and throwing objects) is included in this
  skill. Different stats apply to different weapons, but this ability may
  modify the distance an object is thrown/fired, the amount of damage done,
  and the ability to hit a creature. This skill increases with the level of
  the character.

Saving Throws
  A Saving Throw is the ability of a character to resist the effects of a
  spell cast on him by another person/creature. This does not include
  spells cast on the player by his own stupidity, such as taking a nasty
  pill. This ability increases with the level of the character, but then
  most high level creatures are better at casting spells, so it tends to
  even out. A high wisdom also increases this ability. It is possible to
  get 100% saving throw, making you immune to many attacks.
 
Stealth
  The ability to move silently about is very useful. Characters with good
  stealth can usually surprise their opponents, gaining the first blow.
  Also, creatures may fail to notice a stealthy character entirely,
  allowing a player to avoid certain fights. This skill is based upon race 
  and class, but can be magically enhanced.

Disarming
  Disarming is the ability to remove traps safely, and also includes
  picking locks on traps and doors. A successful disarming will gain the
  character a small amount of experience. A trap must be found before it
  can be disarmed. Traps are either physical or magical devices, so the
  character has two disarming skills.  Dexterity modifies disarming of
  physical traps, and intelligence modifies disarming of magical traps.
  Both these abilities increase with the level of the character.
 
Devices
  Using a device (gadget, gun) requires experience and knowledge. Device
  users such as engineers are therefore much better at using a device than
  say a soldier. This skill is modified by intelligence, and increases
  with the level of the character.

Searching (Perception)
  Perception is the ability to notice traps without actively seeking them
  out.  Rogues are the best at searching, but rangers are also good at it.
  This skill is based on race and class, and increases with character level.
 
Stat Bonus Tables
=================

Stats, hit dice, infravision and experience point modifications due to 
race and class are listed in the following table.  To get the total hit 
dice, add the "race" and "class" numbers: for instance, a Dwarf Priest
has a hit die of 11+2=13 (i.e. they will get 1d13 hit points per level,
adjusted for constitution).

For character classes, there are two figures: the first figure is the base
level of the skill, while the second figure (in parentheses) is the bonus
that the character gains to this skill every ten levels. So, to find out
the total skill value of any character's skills, add the race value to the
class value, and then the bonus once for every ten levels that the
character has.

Please note, however, that these numbers are only good for comparing
characters to each other in the absence of other bonuses from high stats
(strength bonus to-dam, dex bonus to-hit, wisdom bonus to saving throw,
intelligence bonus to magical device usage, etc.) or wearing magical items.

Stat rollers
============

There are currently two different ways to determine the starting stats of
your character - you can choose which one to use from the birth screen.

Point-based
  The point-based method allows you to "buy" improvements to your basic
  stats by "spending" points on them. You have a fixed number of points to
  spend, and making small changes to a stat costs proportionally less than
  making large changes. Any unspent points are converted into your starting
  money that you can use to buy equipment at the start of the game.

  On selecting this option, you will find that the points have already been
  assigned to default recommended values. These represent an algorithm's
  opinion for the ideal point spending. However, you are free to reallocate
  them as you wish.

  This is the recommended birth method.

Standard roller
  The standard roller simply rolls three six-sided dice for each stat,
  leaving everything to chance. You can press ``r`` to re-roll the dice, or
  simply accept what luck has offered.

Character Name
==============

Once you have accepted a character you will asked to provide a name for the
character. In general, the actual choice of a name is not important, but do
keep in mind that it may have some effect on the game itself. For example,
on some machines, the character name determines the filename that will be
used to save the character to disk. The character name is used on the high
score list.

You can play a dynasty of characters. If you use a Roman numeral at the end
of your character name (like "Fred I" or "Pimplesnarg XVI"), the game will
automatically increment the numeral each time you die (or win!).
